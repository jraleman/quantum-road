# Grover's Algorithm / Amplitude Amplification

## About

This is one of the most famous quantum algorithms.
Was introduced in 1996 by Lov Grover.
It was proposed for unstructured search problems, like finding a marked ellement in an unstructured database.
However, now Grover's algorithm is a subroutine to several other algorithms, such as Adaptive Search

## Qiskit

The implementation is in the class `Grover`, that includes:
- The generalized version
- Amplitude Amplification
- Set of individual iterations
- Other meta-settings to Grover's algorithm
